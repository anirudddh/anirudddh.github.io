<div class="content white-text"><p>I recently started building an open community for cyber security enthusiasts and professionals, <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/UM92zUn">The White Circle</a>, no it's not a cult. One of our member and supporter, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sinceraSL">Sincera</a> released his very own CTF challenge yesterday, an awesome journey full of twists and turns with both steganography and ciphers. Let's solve it!</p></div>

<h1 class="cyan-text">Where is the Challenge</h1>

<div class="content white-text"><p>Sincera recently launched his website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.noshitsecurity.com">NoShitSecurity</a>. you can find the challenge here : <a target="_blank" href="https://www.noshitsecurity.com/#au5">Sincera's Au5 Album Release Challenge</a> along with other challenges created by the community.</p></div>

<h1 class="cyan-text">Let's Begin</h1>

<div class="content white-text"><p>Challenge is the album art of a new album release, Answers by Au5. I started off with file command...</p></div>

<pre><code>$ file theanswers.jpg
theanswers.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, aspect ratio, density 144x144, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, big-endian, direntries=5, orientation=upper-left, xresolution=74, yresolution=82, resolutionunit=2], comment: "01100111 01110000 01101010 00101110 01101110 01101111 01110011 01100010 01101001 01100111 01100101 01101000 01110100 00101111 ", baseline, precision 8, 1084x1100, components 3</code></pre>

<div class="content white-text"><p>Take a look at that comment, we can also get this information from exiftool...</p></div>

<pre><code>$ exiftool theanswers.jpg

<div class="content white-text"><p>And we can also see that file command did not display the complete comment so exiftool is a winner here, lets convert this binary into text using Cyber Chef</p></div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>Another image, The Gibson this time, another creation by Sincera, you can take a look at it on his website. This one took a bit of time as I forgot about blank passwords in steghide :(</p></div>

<pre><code>$ steghide extract -sf thegibson.jpg

<div class="content white-text"><p>Interesting a soundcloud link of the new album and another base64 string, lets decode it...</p></div>

<pre><code>$ echo dW95IGRuYSBlbSBmbyBfX19fX19fX19fIHMncmV3c25hIGVodAoKa3h4ZWE6Ly9jc2F3aWVtci5yd3ovUVAyZ3k3anYKClY= | base64 -d

V</code></pre>

<div class="content white-text"><p>First string looks reversed and then there is some cipher text along with a V at the end...</p></div>

<pre><code>$ echo "uoy dna em fo __________ s'rewsna eht" | rev

the answer's __________ of me and you</code></pre>

<div class="content white-text"><p>At this point I pulled up the lyrics of the song and the missing words are : deep inside, now let's take a look at the cipher text, V? Vigenere cipher? It can be decrypted using a key...so I tried deepinside (removed the space) as the key...</p></div>

<div class="center-img">     <img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/JsET1ve.png"> </div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>And we have a pastebin link here which contains just a link...</p></div>

<pre><code>https://www.noshitsecurity.com/theanswer.jpg</code></pre>

<div class="content white-text"><p>At a quick glance it looks like we are going back to the starting point but the file name is actually different! This one took some time as it did not use a blank password and other tools got exhausted as well and I finally reached to my last resort, bruteforce, although you can even guess the password but I don't like guesswork...</p></div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>And we cracked it successfully. Now there are multiple discord server urls present along with some cipher text, let's try variations of ROT cipher...</p></div>
