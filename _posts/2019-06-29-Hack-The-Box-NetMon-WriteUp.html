<div class="content white-text">

	<pre><code>Netmon IP Address : 10.10.10.152

# Basic Port Scan

nmap -F 10.10.10.152
	</code></pre>

	<p>Since FTP port is open we can try Anonymous login...<p>
	<pre><code># username : anonymous
# password : anonymous

ftp 10.10.10.152
	</code></pre>

	<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/BY6EqSf.png">

	<p>Anonymous Login Successful!!</p>
	<p>Now lets dig in deeper...</p>

	<p>
		Inside C:\Users\Public we find user.txt which can be downloaded using get command and inside user.txt we have our first hash.
	<p>

	<p>Now Lets proceed to find the root hash...</p>

	<p>
		Earlier I found out that port 80 is open. On visiting via browser we have a PRTG NETMON Login Page...
	</p>

	<p>Default Username/Password for PRTG NETMON are prtgadmin:prtgadmin but these did not work...</p>

	<p>
		On inspecting the page source I didn't find anything interesting, so lets head back to ftp and look for something related to PRTG NETMON
	</p>

	<p>
		PRTG Default Installation Path is C:/Users/Program Files (x86)/PRTG Network Monitor/ but there are no configuration files in this path, later on I found another path where configuration files are stored : 
	</p>

	<pre><code>C:\ProgramData\Paessler\PRTG Network Monitor\</code></pre>

	<p>inside there are multiple files but the password is in PRTG Configuration.old.bak</p>

	<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/yG0YgJn.png">

	<p>After reading Configuration.old.bak i found the password and username :</p>

	<pre><code>username : prtgadmin
password : PrTg@dmin2018</code></pre>

	<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/ohOWyzI.png">

	<p>
		I tried logging in with these credentials but login failed, but its year 2019 right now so I modified the password as PrTg@dmin2019 and tried again and Login Successful!!
	</p>

	<p>After some poking around in the dashboard I discovered Notification Settings under Account Settings...</p>

	<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/qMair3s.png">

	<p>Here we can Add a new Trigger which will execute a command of our choice...</p>

	<pre><code># Set a custom notification name
# Enable Execute Program option
# In Parameter enter : 

test.txt;more C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt > C:\hash.txt</code></pre>

	<p>
		After saving the new trigger, we can go back and check our new notification trigger, we can launch the trigger using the small play button on the right...
	</p>

	<p>After a while I got hash.txt in C:\ and that is the root hash.</p>
