	<p>
		Choose Linux as Guest operating system (obviously), and choose Other Linux 5.x or later kernel 64-bit since BlackArch Linux uses Linux kernel 5 and above

<h3 class="cyan-text">Disk Settings</h3>
<div class="content white-text">
	<p>

	</p>

	<p>

	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/oA6bTtn.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>
</div>

<h3 class="cyan-text">Installation</h3>
<div class="content white-text">
	<p>
		It's time to boot the VM, if everything was successful and your system support VMs properly you will see this, select first option
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/litm0iG.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<pre><code>Default Username : root
Default Password : blackarch</code></pre>

	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/E3rNSXF.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		Default Desktop Environment is set to Fluxbox, Right click to open menu and choose a terminal
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/I4gkLFa.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<pre><code># Launch blackarch-install
blackarch-install</code></pre>

	<p>
		Choose option 2 since we are using a Live ISO
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/nU8Dqoa.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		You can either set Locale and Keymap or you can use defaults
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/tLPxRBC.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/j1Kj8hu.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		Set hostname of your choice, I used blackarch, after that select correct hard drive, since we are installing this in a VM we don't need dual boot, so choose NO after selecting hard disk
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/hLe04Zc.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		Since it's a fresh installation we will have to make partitions, I will be creating root and boot partitions and not swap, you can create swap similarly if you want to
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/M4zc1wV.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/N9VWZ5K.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/kXXqSyo.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		Select New and set Partition size to 500MB, set it as primary
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/Lcd5q6G.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/tVp8DLq.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		Now select Bootable as shown and this will become our boot partition
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/h3ILzkP.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		Now select free space and set partition size to remaining space, in my case it's 49.5GB after this is done select Write and type yes to confirm and then finally select Quit
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/91reTpP.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/TiBpL9V.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/mdyWQnE.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		Now we have to set are partitions correctly, the smaller 500MB partition was our boot partition and it's label was /dev/sda1 and our large partition was root and it's label was /dev/sda2 and I did not create swap so I will leave the option empty as it says
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/M8VEkeN.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		confirm that our partition table is correct by typing y and then confirm to format partitions by again typing y, after confirmation you will land on something similar to this
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/nFyV0d0.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		wait for sometime and grab more than one coffee because this step takes time :P, after it's over you will be asked to set password for root and if you want to create a normal user account, I did not create a user account for this tutorial
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/Yx9qXOl.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		set a timezone or use default, you can change these after installation is complete, after that you will see this...
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/Y20ftp7.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		REBOOT!!!
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZrQpNs0.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>

	<p>
		And that's it, BlackArch Linux Installed Successfully.
	</p>
